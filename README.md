### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cassandra Lee
I'm working on becoming a full stack developer! I enjoy learning new skills and am focussing on developing the skills I need to start a career in the local tech sector. My background is in geography and geographic information systems (GIS) and I have an M.Sc. from Memorial University. I enjoy hiking, when I get the chance, and am also an avid reader.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first Get Coding module 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I make a lot of my own clothes
